# @exodus/core-selectors

> [!WARNING]
> DEPRECATED: use selectors from [redux modules](../../docs/development/redux-modules.md) instead.

This is a deprecated and unsupported collection of commonly used selectors in Exodus apps. Expect this package to be removed in the future and don't write new code that depends on it.

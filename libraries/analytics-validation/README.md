# @exodus/analytics-validation

## Why

This helps prevent that we do not accidentally collect any sensitive and/or private information, therefore all events must pass a validation layer.

Examples of what could go wrong:

## Development

### Do I need to add a new schema?

```mermaid

    Title(Adding a new telemetry event) --> A
    A{Does your event\nhave properties?}
    A -->|Yes| C
    A -->|No| B
    B(You're done!)
    C{Does it only require\n the 'origin' property?}
    C -->|Yes| B
    C -->|No| E[Generate a new JSON Schema: \nyarn generate analytics-validation]
    E --> D[Adjust the schema and tests]
    D --> B

```

### JSON Schema Development

To add a new schema run

```bash
yarn generate analytics-validation
```

in the project root. The CLI tool will ask you for all details needed.
Once the schema is created, make sure to

1. Before adding a new schema, double check if a subdirectory (essentially an event domain, e.g. `dapps`) already exists in `./src`. If not, you will have to come up with a subdirectory name during the next steps;
2. Fill the schema with the expected properties and their types. The property names must be in the **snake_case** (e.g. `expected_property`);
3. Fix the generated unit test as it will be intentionally failing;
4. Add your own test cases to ensure the schema works properly before merging the PR and publishing a new version.
